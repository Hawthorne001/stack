# Dev Containers

Dev Containers provide all the required tools to contribute to a project. For
Stack these are:

1. The [**Haskell Toolchain**](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/#supported-tools)
    * [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc)
    * [Cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io)
    * [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org)
    * [HLS](https://haskell-language-server.readthedocs.io)  
      :exclamation: Default Dev Container only
1. In addition
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com)
    * [HLint](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlint)
    * [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io)
    * [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net)
    * [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint)

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is used as IDE, with the following
extensions pre-installed:

* [Haskell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell)  
  :exclamation: Default Dev Container only
* [GitHub Pull Requests and Issues](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github)
* [GitLens â€” Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)  
  :information_source: Pinned to version 11.7.0 due to unsolicited AI content
  in recent versions
* [Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)
* [ShellCheck](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck)
* [hadolint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=exiasr.hadolint)
* [Resource Monitor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mutantdino.resourcemonitor)

## Parent images

Stack's Dev Containers are derived from the same docker images used to build
the *statically linked* Linux amd64 and arm64 binary releases of Stack itself.

Those multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64/v8`) *ghc-musl* images are based
on Alpine Linux (i.e. [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org) and
[BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net)) and contain *unofficial* builds of GHC.

To make sure only the GHC available in the Dev Containers is used, flags
`--system-ghc` and `--no-install-ghc` are set system-wide in
`/etc/stack/config.yaml`. Reason:

1. the *official* GHC bindists for Alpine Linux (`x86_64`) are just too buggy.
2. there are currently (2023-09-05) no bindists for Alpine Linux (`AArch64`).

## Usage

For use with Github Codespaces, please follow the instruction at
[Creating a codespace for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).

For local/'remote host' usage with VS Code, please follow the instructions at
[Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

### Persistence

Data in the following locations is persisted:

1. The user's home directory (`/home/vscode`)[^1]
2. The Dev Container's workspace (`/workspaces`)

[^1]: Alternatively for the root user (`/root`). Use with Docker/Podman in
*rootless mode*.

This is accomplished either via a *volume* or *bind mount* (or *loop device* on
Codespaces) and is preconfigured.

## Build Stack

### Using cabal

:exclamation: Default Dev Container only.

Command `cabal build` to build the `stack` executable.

Append `--flag=static` to build a *statically linked* `stack` executable that
can run on any Linux machine of the same architecture.

### Using Stack

Command `stack build` to build the `stack` executable.

Append `--flag=stack:static` to build a *statically linked* `stack` executable
that can run on any Linux machine of the same architecture.

Append `--stack-yaml stack-ghc-$GHC_VERSION.yaml` if you want to use an
experimental project-level configuration with the appropriate Dev Container.

## Haskell Language Server (HLS)

The
[Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)
and the
[Haskell extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell)
are only available in the default Dev Container.

In order to use the Haskell extension, you must first configure the project for
the build tool of your choice:

**Stack**

Place the cradle ([hie.yaml](assets/cradles/stack/hie.yaml)) for Stack in the
root of the workspace: `cp -f .devcontainer/assets/cradles/stack/hie.yaml .`

**Cabal**

Place the cradle ([hie.yaml](assets/cradles/cabal/hie.yaml)) for Cabal in the
root of the workspace: `cp -f .devcontainer/assets/cradles/cabal/hie.yaml .`

This should suffice to configure the HLS explicitly for `./Setup.hs` and each
of the buildable components in Stack's Cabal file.

### Haskell extension

Choose `Manually via PATH` when asked the following question:
